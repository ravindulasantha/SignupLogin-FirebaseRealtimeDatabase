![Screen Shot](https://github.com/ravindulasantha/SignupLogin-FirebaseRealtimeDatabase/blob/main/ssgit.png)

GitHub project "Login and Signup using Firebase Realtime Database in Android Studio | Store Data" is a sample Android application that demonstrates how to implement user authentication and data storage using Firebase Realtime Database in Android Studio. The app provides users with a login and signup interface where they can create an account or log in to an existing one.

Once authenticated, the user's data is stored in Firebase Realtime Database, a cloud-hosted NoSQL database that allows for real-time synchronization between the app and the backend server. The app demonstrates how to implement Firebase Authentication, which provides secure user authentication using email and password, as well as Firebase Realtime Database, which enables the storage and retrieval of user data in real-time.

The project's code is written in Java and follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. The app uses various components from the Android Jetpack library, such as Navigation, ViewModel, and LiveData. The app's UI is built using XML layout files and includes various widgets such as EditText, TextView, and Buttons.
